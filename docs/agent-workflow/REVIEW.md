# Independent Copilot review

The reviewer runs in a new Copilot CLI process and receives committed artifacts,
not the implementation conversation. Its model-facing tools are `view`, `grep` and
`glob`. The wrapper performs Git/GitHub operations outside that model process.

## Managed skill procedure

Use `$agentic-review PR #456` to coordinate the existing snapshot/run/publication
steps with a recorded task and approved plan. Use `$agentic-repair PR #456` afterwards
to retrieve both submitted reviews and inline comments and resume the exact Astra
implementation UUID. The standalone review skill completes review; the complete
workflow skill coordinates subsequent repair and re-review. See [SKILLS.md](SKILLS.md).

One attempted round per task is the default. A supported critical P0/P1 finding permits
a further round to verify its repair; the coordinator records the public finding and
concrete reason through the continuation flags. Other extra rounds need an explicit
user request. P2/P3 findings, uncertain questions and incomplete coverage do not by
themselves permit another round. Every additional invocation needs its own recorded
basis; see [the continuation procedure](SKILLS.md). A failed or incomplete run does not
establish readiness. Keep the original report intact and publish dispositions separately.

## Local procedure

From the clean main checkout on the default branch:

```bash
python3 scripts/agentic/review.py prepare 456 --issue 123 --plan-comment 987654321
```

The command prints a private directory under `.agentic-local/reviews/`. Use that exact
path in the next commands:

```bash
python3 scripts/agentic/review.py run /absolute/path/printed/by/prepare
# Read review.md and confirm its evidence before publication.
python3 scripts/agentic/review.py publish /absolute/path/printed/by/prepare
```

`prepare` checks the plan's issue association and the current PR head/base. It fetches
the PR and base refs, computes the merge base, collects the complete textual diff,
issue and PR comments, inline findings, reviews, status contexts and check runs.
Pagination covers all timeline/review/check pages. Source files are read as Git blobs.
No PR checkout, Git filter, project hook or project command is executed.

The snapshot contains an index mapping original paths to numbered `.txt` files, so
repository agent settings, hooks and skills cannot become active configuration.
Git symlinks and submodules are listed as omissions and never followed. Known private
and data directories are excluded; a diff touching such paths is refused before it is
transmitted. This path policy is a baseline, not a content-based secret detector.
Inspect your own source and augment exclusions for a project's restricted paths.

The default budgets are 300 KB of diff, 250 KB per source file, 12 MB of total text,
15 minutes and 400 Copilot AI credits. These are operational choices, not claims
about model capacity or price. Per-file omissions are recorded explicitly; oversized
diffs and total snapshots fail rather than silently presenting a partial review as
complete. Credit limits are provider controls and may overshoot by a request already
in flight. Split broad changes before raising budgets.

`run` copies the packet to a fresh workspace outside the repository, then uses fresh Copilot state, disabled hooks, no built-in MCP server, no inherited
provider override and no permission to execute, edit or delegate. Prompt-mode memory
and resume are not enabled. Repository policy and domain rubric come from the trusted
main checkout and are explicitly supplied as text. The requested model is recorded;
the template does not claim it independently attests to the provider's internal model
identity. Inspect `usage.json` and provider session metadata when that matters.
The tool controls follow the [Copilot CLI reference](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/copilot-cli-reference/cli-command-reference)
and [custom agent configuration](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/custom-agents-configuration).

`publish` rechecks head and base, verifies snapshot and report hashes, and creates a
COMMENT review with an explicit `commit_id`. Repeated publication of the same report
returns its existing review URL. Any new head/base requires a new snapshot. Findings
do not automatically become approval, a green required check, or resolved threads.

The review directory is private working state, not a cryptographic attestation against
its own owner. Its hashes catch accidental edits. A user able to rewrite the manifest
can rewrite the record, so GitHub permissions and human assessment remain necessary.

## Why the snapshot differs from the PDF's detached checkout

A detached worktree reduces branch mistakes but is not a read-only security boundary:
an agent with shell access can still edit files, push a SHA or inspect shared credentials.
This implementation strengthens the review boundary by exporting committed text and
limiting tools. It also prevents a PR from installing its own reviewer hooks.

For independent execution tests, a human can create a detached worktree in a suitable
environment and run inspected commands without giving the model execution permission:

```bash
git fetch origin refs/pull/456/head
git worktree add --detach ../PROJECT-worktrees/review-pr-456 FULL_REVIEWED_HEAD_SHA
```

Confirm the fetched SHA matches the record. Test environments write caches and may
execute arbitrary project code; use disposable infrastructure for unfamiliar code.
Attach command and commit evidence to the PR. The static reviewer must never describe
those tests as having executed them itself.

## Report contract

| Severity | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| P0 | Catastrophic, concrete merge blocker |
| P1 | Likely major correctness or security failure in supported use |
| P2 | Reachable edge-case defect or substantive evidence gap |
| P3 | Minor optional improvement; suppress tooling-covered style remarks |

Every finding needs **location, claim, trigger, impact, evidence and minimal fix
direction**. Use original repository paths and line numbers from the mapped source,
not the numbered snapshot filenames. Demonstrate the reachable code path or provide
a reproducible test proposal. Do not invent executed commands.

End with:

1. Acceptance criteria verified or still unsupported.
2. Validation independently executed, if any; the static CLI reviewer executes none.
3. Limitations, omitted source, inaccessible artifacts and residual risks.

Explicitly state when no material finding is supported. Treat uncertain concerns as
questions, not proven defects. Check negative inputs, missing data, ties, NaNs,
interruption, compatibility, concurrency and numerical boundaries where relevant.
For scientific changes apply [the domain rubric](domain-review.md).

## Manual Actions procedure

Complete the protected-environment setup in [SETUP.md](SETUP.md#6-enable-manual-actions-review).
Then use **Actions → manual Copilot review → Run workflow**, on the default branch.
Select the PR, issue, plan comment ID and exact head. Choose publication only when
you intend to post the generated report; otherwise download and inspect the artifact.

```bash
gh workflow run copilot-review.yml --ref main \
  -f pr=456 -f issue=123 -f plan_comment=987654321 \
  -f head_sha=FULL_CURRENT_PR_HEAD_SHA -F publish=false
```

Generation and publication are separate jobs. The model job has only read permissions;
the publication job has PR write permission and does not run a model. Neither checks
out or executes PR code. Same-repository PRs only are supported. Forks and non-default
base branches need a separate reviewed isolation procedure, not a bypass flag.

The workflow is deliberately opt-in and manual. It has no issue-comment trigger,
automatic repair loop, model token on ordinary PR checks, or self-hosted runner.
Changing the workflow or its credentials is T4 work.

## Model selection and repair

The configuration requests exactly `claude-opus-5`. Other Opus versions and Claude
families are separate choices and are not automatic substitutes. Choose another explicit
Claude ID only after checking account availability and deciding the cost is
justified. Do not use `auto`, a built-in agent that silently
selects another family, or the implementation conversation as a review session.
Native GitHub Copilot code review is a separate service and does not let you pin this
Claude choice; see [GitHub's code review description](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/code-review).

Local preparation reads configuration from the caller's clean main checkout;
Actions reads it from the trusted default branch. A model-change PR takes effect
for the standard review procedure after the maintainer merges it and the local
main checkout is updated. The normal procedure reviews the introducing PR under the existing trusted configuration.
An explicit maintainer instruction to use the new model/budget for that PR permits
a narrowly scoped override in the trusted invocation. Record the authorization and
exact values in fresh packet metadata; do not activate unreviewed PR instructions or
rewrite existing packets. This is how the Opus/400-credit transition was authorized. Changing an interactive Copilot model preference
does not override this wrapper's explicit `--model` argument.

Prepare a fresh packet after a model change. Each packet records its requested
model and budgets at preparation; changing `.agentic/config.json` afterwards does
not retarget that packet. Check `metadata.json`, `review.md`, and CLI-reported
`usage.json` for the actual run. Configuration and mocked tests do not prove live
account access. Historical Sonnet pilot results in `VERIFICATION.md` remain
evidence for those earlier runs, not evidence of Opus inference. Historical Fable
reports are likewise retained under their original model and budgets.

Managed repair remains an Astra task on the original branch **and original session
UUID**. A missing UUID must be recovered rather than replaced or selected with
`--last`. The legacy interactive launcher remains a manual alternative that starts
a separate session. Post a finding-by-finding
response with commits and evidence. One attempted round remains the default; additional
review follows the critical-finding or explicit-continuation policy above. A larger
per-review credit allowance does not authorize more rounds or establish completeness.

### Claude Opus 5 access

Checked on 2026-09-14. GitHub lists Claude Opus 5 as generally available and supports
it in Copilot CLI for eligible plans. Business and Enterprise administrators may need
to enable its model policy. Check the actual authenticated account rather than infer
availability from a template setting. See [GitHub's Opus 5 announcement](https://github.blog/changelog/2026-07-24-claude-opus-5-is-now-available-in-github-copilot/)
and [current supported models](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/ai-models/supported-models).

The 400-credit setting is a provider-enforced soft allowance for this single-prompt
review invocation, not a price quote or guarantee of complete inspection. Actual usage
may overshoot at a request boundary. Preserve `usage.json` and report any incomplete
coverage. See [GitHub's credit-limit reference](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/copilot-cli-reference/cli-command-reference#command-line-options).

Private-path exclusions and static tool restrictions remain in force. The snapshot's
ordinary source and public comments are sent to Copilot for the authorized review.
